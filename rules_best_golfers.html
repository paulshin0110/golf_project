          <h2>Basic Rules For Golfing</h2>
          <hr>
          <aside>
            <p>Unlike other sports, a golfer's real enemy is never his or her opponent but him/herself and more importantly, his or her surroundings.That is one reason why the game has managed to keep a sense of sportsmanship at its heart - because even at the highest level golfers are united in their battle against the course as much as each other.If you're new to the sport, either as a player or spectator, our guide to the basics will provide an insight into what it's all about.There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers. Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.
